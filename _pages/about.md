Research Activity 
======
My research activity concerns the study of strongly interacting theories in the Standard Model (SM) and beyond
(BSM). In particular I have been studying field theories regularised on a space-time lattice, the only known
approach which allow for first-principle computations through numerical Monte Carlo techniques. During the
beginning of my career I mainly focused on aspects of QCD relevant for the phenomenology of flavour physics
and CP-violating processes within the SM and Beyond. Starting with my master thesis and during the PhD I
mainly contributed in non-perturbative (high-precision) renormalization of fundamental parameters of the SM
and renormalization of composite operators appearing in the effective weak Hamiltonian approach of processes
relevant for improving constraints on CKM and new physics. The setup employed for the above calculations is the
Schr√∂dinger Functional (SF) renormalization scheme, which allows through a finite volume recursive procedure
to compute the non-perturbative renormalization and running over several order of magnitude in energy and
even address directly the calculation of the non-perturbative anomalous dimension. More specifically I worked on
the renormalization of the tensor current (Nf = 0,2), the BSM 4-fermion operators (Nf = 2) and the quark
masses (Nf = 3). All these projects are part of the ALPHA collaboration renormalization program. Currently I
branched out my interests to several different aspects of gauge theories, focusing in particular on the numerical
implementation and exploration of a UV complete partial composite Higgs scenario based on an SU(4) gauge
group and fermions in multiple representation. Given the UV completeness of the model under investigation, it
constitutes a perfect candidate to be studied on the lattice. Strictly related to this project, I am also contributing
to the advancement of GRID: a new generation C++ library for lattice simulation mainly developed by the
Edinburgh Lattice group. In parallel with the latter project I am active in the development of new algorithms inspired by the "multi-level" to improve the precision in spectroscopy of both fundamental and excited bound states on the lattice. I am
also recently fascinated by the possibility of numerical simulations of quantum gravity on the lattice. While this
problem is notoriously very intricate, a lattice exploration can be fundamental to establish non-perturbatively the
existence of a possible "asymptotic-safety" scenario, without resort to any perturbative approximation.
