We determine from first principles the quark mass anomalous dimension in Nf=3 QCD 
between the electroweak and hadronic scales. This allows for a fully 
non-perturbative connection of the perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of the 
Standard Model in the hadronic sector. The computation is carried out to high accuracy, 
employing massless O(a)-improved Wilson quarks and finite-size scaling techniques. 
We also provide the matching factors required in the renormalisation of light quark 
masses from lattice computations with O(a)-improved Wilson fermions and a tree-level 
Symanzik improved gauge action. The total uncertainty due to renormalisation and 
running in the determination of light quark masses in the SM is thus reduced to about 1%
