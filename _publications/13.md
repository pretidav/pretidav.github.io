We present preliminary result for the study of the renormalization group evolution of tensor bilinears in Schrödinger Functional (SF) schemes for Nf = 0 and Nf = 2 QCD with non-perturbatively
O(a)-improved Wilson fermions. First Nf = 2+1 results (proceeding in parallel with the ongoing computation of the running quark masses [arXiv:1508.06939]) are also discussed. A one-loop perturbative calculation of the discretisation effects for the relevant step scaling functions has been carried
out for both Wilson and O(a)-improved actions and for a large number of lattice resolutions.
We also calculate the two-loop anomalous dimension in SF schemes for tensor currents through
a scheme matching procedure with RI and MS. Thanks to the SF iterative procedure the nonperturbative running over two orders of magnitude in energy scales, as well as the corresponding
Renormalization Group Invariant operators, have been determined
