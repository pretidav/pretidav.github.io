We present a nearly final analysis of the u/d and s quark masses, extracted using the PCAC quark
masses reported in [PRD 95 (2017) 074504]. The data is based on the CLS Nf = 2+1 simulations with Wilson/Clover quarks and Lüscher-Weisz gauge action, at four β values (i.e. lattice spacings) and a range of quark masses. We use the ALPHA results of [EPJC 78 (2018) 387] for non-perturbative quark mass renormalisation and RG-running from hadronic to electroweak scales in the Schrödinger Functional scheme. Quark masses are quoted both in the MS scheme and as RGI quantities.
