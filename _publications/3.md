A mixed action composed of valence quark flavours regularized with a fully-twisted tmQCD
action and of Nf = 2 + 1 flavours of non-perturbatively O(a)-improved Wilson sea quarks is
described. Two procedures for the matching of sea and valence quark masses are discussed. We
report about a comparison of the continuum-limit scaling of pseudoscalar meson observables and
of quark masses using the sea and valence actions.
