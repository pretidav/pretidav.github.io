We present preliminary results of a non-perturbative study of the scale-dependent renormalization constants of a complete basis of ∆F = 2 parity-odd four-fermion operators that enter the
computation of hadronic B-parameters within the Standard Model (SM) and beyond. We consider non-perturbatively O(a) improved Wilson fermions and our gauge configurations contain
two flavors of massless sea quarks. The mixing pattern of these operators is the same as for a
regularization that preserves chiral symmetry, in particular there is a "physical" mixing between
some of the operators. The renormalization group running matrix is computed in the continuum limit for a family of Schrödinger Functional (SF) schemes through finite volume recursive
techniques. We compute non-perturbatively the relation between the renormalization group invariant operators and their counterparts renormalized in the SF at a low energy scale, together
with the non-perturbative matching matrix between the lattice regularized theory and the various
SF schemes
