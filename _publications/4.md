We present preliminary results in the charm sector from a mixed-action setup, in which CLS
Nf = 2 + 1 ensembles are combined with a Wilson twisted mass valence action. We study the
continuum and chiral limits of charm quark observables such as the decay constants fD(s)
and the renormalized charm-quark mass.
