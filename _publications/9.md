Tensor currents are the only quark bilinear operators lacking a non-perturbative determination of their renormalisation group (RG) 
running between hadronic 
and electroweak scales. We develop the setup to carry out the computation in lattice QCD 
via standard recursive finite-size scaling techniques, and provide 
results for the RG running of tensor currents in Nf=0 and Nf=2 QCD in the 
continuum for various Schr√∂dinger Functional schemes. The matching factors between bare and 
renormalisation group invariant currents are also determined for a range of values of the 
lattice spacing relevant for large-volume simulations, thus enabling a fully 
non-perturbative renormalization of physical amplitudes mediated by tensor currents.
