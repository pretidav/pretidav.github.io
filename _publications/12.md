We present our preliminary results for the computation of the non-perturbative running of renormalized quark masses in Nf = 3 QCD, between the electroweak and hadronic scales, using standard finite-size scaling techniques. The computation is carried out to very high precision, using
massless O(a) improved Wilson quarks. Following the strategy adopted by the ALPHA Collaboration for the running coupling, different schemes are used above and below a scale µ0 ∼ mb,
which differ by using either the Schrödinger Functional or Gradient Flow renormalized coupling. We discuss our results for the running in both regions, and the procedure to match the
two schemes.
